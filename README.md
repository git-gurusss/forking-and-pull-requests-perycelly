# Forking and Pull Requests Assignment

Welcome to the **Forking and Pull Requests** assignment! üéâ This assignment will help you learn the basics of **forking** a repository, making changes, and submitting those changes through a **pull request (PR)**.

## Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:
* Learn how to fork a repository and manage your own copy
* Edit files effectively in your forked repository
* Create and submit pull requests to propose changes to the original repository

## Instructions

### Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. Navigate to the repository page
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner
3. Wait for GitHub to create a copy in your account

### Step 2: Clone Your Forked Repository (Optional)

If you prefer working locally:


# Clone your forked repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/forking-and-pull-requests.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd forking-and-pull-requests
### Step 3: Make Changes

Open example.txt in your preferred editor
Replace the existing content with:
Student has made a change.

Save the file

### Step 4: Commit Your Changes
If working locally:
# Stage your changes
git add example.txt

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Edited example.txt as part of the assignment"

# Push to your fork
git push origin main
If using GitHub's web interface:

Navigate to example.txt in your fork
Click the edit button (pencil icon)
Make your changes
Add a meaningful commit message
Click "Commit changes"

### Step 5: Create a Pull Request (PR)

Visit the original repository
Select the "Pull Requests" tab
Click "New Pull Request"
Select your fork as the source
Provide a clear title and description
Submit your pull request
